 Learning VisionOS

A collection of small things I learn today about visionOS development. It will be a vault to see what I had learnt previously, and see how I did it when I get confused about swiftUI.

## Why do I have to be a visionOS developer?

I am always intrigued by the idea of transforming a flat digital screen into an interactive extended screen. After experimenting with the Meta Quest platform using Unity, I found that ecosystem continuity was a significant challenge. I believe that with Apple's ecosystem, Vision Pro can refine and establish the concept of spatial computing apps. Despite lacking a computer science background, I am eager to embrace this challenge and enhance people's interactive experiences with the world.
