- We use @binding to connect the state from parent view to child view.
- EX) when a button in the parent view clicked, the colour of child view gets changed.
- Binding mean, state got declared somewhere else, and we are connecting together.


```Swift
struct ContentView: View {
	@State var backgroundColor: Color = Color.clear

	var body: some View{
		ZStack{
			backgroundColor

			Button(action: {
				backgroundColor: .blue
				}, label: {
					Text("Button")
				})
		}
	}
}
```

- We extract the button into subview and bind the variable.
- We declare which variable and data will get bind together using @binding
```Swift
struct ButtonView: View {
	@Binding var backgroundColor: Color

	var body: some View{
		Button(action:{
			backgroundColor: .blue
		}, label: {
			Text("Button")
		})
	}
}
```


- ParentView will have the subview called ButtonView
- But this time, we declare the value inside the subview is connected to the parental variables
- using $ Dollar sign
```Swift
ZStack{
	   backgroundColor

		ButtonView(backgroundColor: $backgroundColor)
}
```
