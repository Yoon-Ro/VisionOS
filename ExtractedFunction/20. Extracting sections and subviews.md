#section #subviews

the amount of code within the body of a View can get very long. 
- To avoid this, we will learn how to keep our SwiftUI code readable and manageable 
- by extracting sections of the view from the body and into their own variables / functions.

### Example 1 (Default)
```Swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
	@State var myBackground : Color = Color.clear
	@State var buttonBackground : Color = Color.yellow

	var body: some View {
	NaivgationStack{
		ZStack{
			myBackground

			VStack{
			Text("title").font(.largeTitle)
			Button(action: {
				myBackground = .blue
				buttonBackground = .white
			}, label: {
				Text("Button")
			}).background(buttonBackground)
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
- We've been adding functions inside the button, because example was pretty short.
- But we have to extract it when it gets too long and hard to understand


- We will extract a function outside of body View and embed it inside.
- ex) colour changing functions will be replace with simpler name
```swift
func buttonPressed() {
	myBackground = .blue
	buttonBackground = .white
}
```

- Now, we add a `buttonPressed()` inside the button's action
```Swift
Button(action: {
	buttonPressed()
})
```


- Also, we can extract the subView  (VStack) outside of body View
```swift
var contentLayer : some View {
			VStack{
				Text("title").font(.largeTitle)
			Button(action: {
				buttonPressed()
			}, label: {
				Text("Button")
			}).background(buttonBackground)
				}
}
```


- Now, our main View will look like the example
```swift
ZStack{
	myBackground
	contentLayer
}
```
